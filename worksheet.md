# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
  github is known for a cloud-based service for software development and version control using Git, store and manage codes. bitbucket is a Git-based source code repository hosting service, offers both commercial plans and free accounts with an unlimited number of private repositories.

  GitHub is fit for public repositories work while bitbucket is more for private repositories work.

  * Who made the last commit to repository A? github
  * Who made the first commit to repository A? bitbucket
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B? github
  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened? Both are inactive right noe because Proggramers have finised coding their projects.
  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity? repository A

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

Red vs. Blue
